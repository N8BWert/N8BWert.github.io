				<p>
					My name is Nathaniel Wert and I am currently a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with threads in Devices and Intelligences. 
					<br><br>
					At Georgia Tech, I am involved in the RoboCup division of Robojackets (the robotics team), a member of The Agency (the artificial intelligence club), and a member of the Startup Exchange club.
					In Robocup, I am currently redesigning the offensive ball handler role to be more dynamic and responsive to the changes of both team's robots positions.
					<br><br>
					Outside of Georgia Tech, I am constantly exploring new technologies, languages, and frameworks to build interesting <a href="Projects.html" id="portfolio"> projects.</a> One such project that I am currently working on
					is a more dynamic recommender system to allow for an ease of music discovery. This project is not yet published in my projects page (as it is not finished yet), but I look forward to showing off the IOS
					application in mid-2022.
					<br><br>
					When I'm not programming or developing, I also love to play music. Currently, I play the guitar, bass, keyboard, and saxophone and am always looking for the next band/song to listen to.
					<br><br>
					If you believe I might be a perfect fit for your company or project feel free to send me an email or contact me by phone. My resume is also available <a href="NathanielWert-Resume.pdf" id="portfolio" download>here. </a>
