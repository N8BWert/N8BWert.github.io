                        Every time that I work with Ros I complain about how inefficient and odd the communication methods are.  Every time 
                        Ros sends a message it has to serialize the message in some way that it can be read by both python and c++ and then it literally 
                        sends the data over LAN.  Honestly, this takes forever and is super inefficient just so that people can write their high level 
                        algorithms in python.
                        <br>
                        **stepping off of my soapbox**
                        <br>
                        Anyways, NComm is a solution to Ros's slow message passing.  The idea with NComm is to utilize nodes that each have a setup, update,
                        and shutdown function and perform in immediate mode (basically every node has an update rate and will run their update code during that
                        time).  Then, I can easily use modern message sharing (specifically channels) to share rust-native types across nodes to allow for 
                        incredibly fast message passing performance.
                        <br><br>
                        TLDR: Ros is super inefficient about passing messages so I made a communication library for Nodes in rust to do what Ros does,
                        but significantly better.

                        As a proof of concept, I created a static large file storage system using the Rust Rocket framework.  The experience was enjoyable
                        and has led to me considering using the basic template of this application for any future large file storage projects I need.

                        For the second Georgia Tech IEEE Robotech hackathon, my team attempted to create an assistive knee brace to help with knee joint 
                        mobility.  The project did end up being a bit of a hot mess with the raspberry pi pico we were using breaking before our demo wiping 
                        all of our code.  The links below are to the flask server that served comm streamed accelerometer data to an IOS app.

                        Another project I completed during my time at Kudelski Security was a contribution to the open-source ossf scorecard project. 
                        My main contribution to Scorecard was a GitLab client that added a new platform for scorecard to work with.  This was my first 
                        time contributing significantly to a massive open source project so I was incredibly surprised when my work won a 
                        Google open-source peer-bonus award.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        As a small(er) side project at my Software Engineering Co-Op (Kudelski Security), I made a rust program to run a plaintext attack against the rc4 stream cipher.  The project
                        started off in C, but I thought it would be fun to try my hand at a programming language I had never used before (rust) so that I could utilize the full concurrency of my
                        computer.  After adding in multithreading I also thought it would be interesting to write a CUDA kernel to use a CUDA-enabled GPU to run the plaintext attack against cr4 for
                        specific key sizes.  I would definitely not consider myself an expert with CUDA kernel programming, however I did manage to mess up my computers graphics driver the first time
                        I ran my CUDA-enabled code, which I would consider a huge win.

                        Did you know you could pretty easily grow oyster mushrooms from pretty much any bucket.  Neither did I, before I began this project.  As part of Georgia Tech's IEEE
                        robotics hackathon (robotech), I worked with a team to create an automatic mushroom farming robot.  The principle was that oyster mushrooms tend to grow horizontally 
                        out of buckets when they are provided the right conditions.  This makes it pretty easy to design a large spinning blade that harvests the mushrooms when they are fully
                        grown.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this is one of my favorite projects I've ever worked on.  In the future, there is a very high likelihood of me taking this concept back out of the garage and
                        creating a (possibly) open-sourced fully-working version that uses my NComm framework to allow for mesh network of IoT farming robots.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Freshman year of college I was apart of the Georgia Tech Living Learning Community Grand Challenges.  In Grand Challenges, the main goal of the class
                        was to attempt to develop some solution to a major problem.  My team interviewed a large number (I think 15 but I don't 100% remember) of individuals and 
                        organizations involved in hurricane search and rescue.  Throughout the process we realized that communication between NGOs, base camp, first responders,
                        the state and local government, and survivors was heavily lacking following a major disaster.  This project was a (very) rough simulation I developed to simulate the different
                        levels of efficiency for search and rescue assuming base camp notified first responders of the location of a survivor at specific intervals.
                        <br><br>
                        In general, looking back at the simulation.  It is a bit week and makes quiet a few large assumptions regarding the search and rescue patterns of first responders
                        but it, nonetheless, was a pretty interesting project created.

                        Fallacy was a project for the Brackeys 2022.1 game jam that I completed with one of my roommates.  Overall, the game didn't turn out
                        too bad, but it also wasn't the greatest game I've ever made (I still hold that my best game was error 404).

                        In 2021, I participated in HackGT 8 at Georgia Tech.  For the project my team worked on an application to allow users to 
                        answer poll questions at the dinning halls to help get more up-to-date information regarding the contents of the Georgia Tech 
                        Dining Halls.  I participated as the primary backend developer for the team where I used a consensus algorithm to weight user
                        input to obtain a semi-accurate picture of what is at the dinning halls at a specific moment.

                        Back in High School I participated in a competition to develop some technology to solve an issue.  I choose to focus on assisting
                        police officers to safely navigate traffic stops.  Overall, the project was relatively competent, but had a severe lack of mobility
                        and was a bit boxy.  In the future I might make a version 2 of this project using the knowledge I've gained since I created this project.

                        I know what you're probably thinking.  Why on Earth does this look so much worse than your first game.  Well the reason
                        for that is I completed this game for the 47th Ludum Dare Game Jam but had to work both the Friday and Sunday of the jam
                        meaning I didn't exactly have a ton of time.  I did, however, finish a game during the small amount of time I had and, although
                        it definitely doesn't look or play great, am relatively proud of the game.
